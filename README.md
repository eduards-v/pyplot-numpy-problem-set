# pyplot-numpy-problem-set
Problem set to solve using pyplot and numpy using Jupyter Notebook API

## Data gathering 

In this problem set we have to use Fisher's Iris data set to demonstrate numpy library capabilities to work
with data lists and pyplot library for ploting data sets into visual representation. 

I've found row tabular data set [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data)
and saved it as `.csv` file.
CSV file is convenient way to store tabular data sets. Python libraries like numpy provide implementation 
for reading data into lists from `.csv`

## Reading data from `.csv` file

numpy library contains functions to load different type of files, including .csv into python lists.
